#Study Plan for jquery
1. look for general explanation of jquery and uses
	* Cheat sheet
	* Documentation
2. Spend 30 mins looking up material and how to use it.
3. Start practicing with commands and explore how it all works
4. check what each change did and see if it did what was expected.


#findings
1. I found that finding a cheat sheet for jquery was the best start the documentation was difficult to understand. 
2. I found reading to be less useful than actually putting the code in and making stuff happen. 
3. I found it to be overall fun to learn new things this way if not a little frustrating when problems arose, but eventrually reqwarding when being able to fix the problem.
