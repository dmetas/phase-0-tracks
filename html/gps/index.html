1. What is the purpose of html5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
semantic tags helps with readibility by adding names that make snese. I like section because it helps me organize blocks of similar items. 

2. what is the order the browers uses to display elemnts on a page?
the browser will read all items from top to bottom left to right.

3. what did you learn in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I found snippits to be the most interesting thing I learend today. I deffinetly will want to make snippets at a later date because I think they could really help with repetitive typing. 

4. What concept in this challnge was the most difficutl for you? How can you improve your understaning of this concept?
The most difficult concept for me was the snippets at first. It took me a while to understand the sytax and while talking with our guide it seems like theres alot more I need to learn about it as it has alot of capabilities that go beyond the basic look. I want to look into this in more detail and find how best to implement snippets into the code.
