# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to have multiple people working on different features without effecting the master code branch. This is useful because multiple people can work on different features at the same time and if there is something broken in the code it will be what was just added into the master branch.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master code that can be worked on without effecting the master code file until it has been merged in. branches also allow a team to work on separate features at one time. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point that can be referenced back at a later time. A good commit message should be detailed and state what was changed since the last commit.
* What is a merge conflict?
From the time you take a file from master and the time in where the file is merged back into master. The specific lines you are trying to merge have somehow been altered or removed before the merge takes place.
